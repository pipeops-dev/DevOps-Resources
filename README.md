    <td>Create cloud native apps with Azure and open-source software</td>
    <td>Cloud-native apps represent a modern approach to app development, where software systems are designed with cloud scale and capabilities in mind. Cloud-native apps build on open source technologies where feasible, with a focus on architectural modularity. In focusing on open technologies, "Cloud Native", means flexibility of deployment target, while still being able to use Azure-specific services like Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Active Directory.

This hands-on learning path covers the essentials of selecting components for cloud-native apps, building the integrations, and deploying to Azure.

You'll create multiple services, processing both large scale of messages from devices and streaming data from IoT devices.</td>
